# TabColor

## Overview
This Firefox extension allows users to select a color from a pop-up menu to re-style their chosen tab for aesthetic and orgnizational benefits. 

## Example
The screenshot below shows two different title bar colors for different windows. One can press the reset button in the pop-up to return to the default color and theme. All themes are accessible based on AAA color contrast.
