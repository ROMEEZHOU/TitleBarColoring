## Guideline for adding new functions

If you aim at helping us adding new functions, you should make sure that the new functions are consistent with the goal and values of this addon and our community.

We also welcome you to discuss with the leadership and you can find the discord channel [here](https://discord.gg/aKUQRYZrFB).

## Code style

If you are aditing an existing file or adding new code files, code style should be consistent with the rest of the code in the file and other existing files. Please comment when necessary. At the same time, if there are references, please include them as comment at the beginning of the code file. For more general standard, follow the guideline [here](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebExtensions/Hacking#Code_Style).
